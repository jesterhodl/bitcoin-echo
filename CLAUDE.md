# Bitcoin Echo — C Implementation Context

## Critical Constraints

**You must follow these constraints in all implementation work:**

1. **Pure C11** — No C++ features, no extensions beyond rotation intrinsics
2. **Zero external dependencies** — Only C compiler and standard library (+ SQLite, which is embedded)
3. **Consensus engine purity** — No I/O, no system calls, no dynamic allocation during validation
4. **Simplicity over optimization** — Correct and clear beats fast and clever
5. **15,000–25,000 lines target** — Every line must justify its existence
6. **Heavy commenting** — Code must be understandable by auditor in 2125
7. **No future features** — Implement what exists in Bitcoin today, nothing speculative

## Code Style

- Functions are obvious in purpose
- Every branch justifiable by protocol specification
- No clever tricks
- Bounds checking on all buffers
- Constants over magic numbers
- Descriptive names over abbreviations

## Context Loading Strategy

To avoid context window limits and ensure focused implementation:
1. **DO NOT read full source files (.c)** for completed modules unless you are modifying them.
2. **Read `include/*.h`** to understand available APIs and types.
3. **Read ONLY the specific `.c` file** you are currently working on.
4. Treat other modules as **black boxes** based on their headers.

## Architecture Layers

```
Application Layer     — Node operation, RPC, logging
Protocol Layer        — P2P messages, peers, mempool
Consensus Engine      — FROZEN CORE (block/tx validation, chain selection)
Platform Abstraction  — OS interface (sockets, threads, files, time, entropy)
```

Information flows down as function calls, up as return values. Lower layers know nothing of higher layers.

## What NOT To Do

- Don't add features beyond Bitcoin protocol as it exists today
- Don't optimize at the expense of clarity
- Don't use external libraries (embed everything)
- Don't make the consensus engine touch I/O
- Don't create abstractions for one-time operations
- Don't add configuration options or runtime flags
- Don't write wallet functionality

## Quick Reference

**Signature verification seam:** `sig_verify.h` / `sig_verify.c` — the quantum succession boundary

**Platform interface:** See whitepaper Appendix A for complete API

**Supported soft forks:** P2SH, BIP-66, CLTV, CSV, SegWit, Taproot

**Test vectors:** Embed Bitcoin Core's consensus test suite; 100% pass required

## Session Completion Workflow

**After completing each session and all tests pass:**

1. **Update roadmap** — Mark session complete in `bitcoinecho-org/ROADMAP.md` with status and test count
3. **Commit bitcoin-echo** — Commit implementation changes with descriptive message
4. **Commit bitcoinecho-org** — Commit roadmap update
5. **Push both repos** — Push changes to GitHub
6. **Pause and check in** — Wait for user confirmation before starting next session

## When Uncertain

Consult in order:
1. The whitepaper (authoritative specification)
2. Bitcoin Core source (reference implementation)
3. BIPs (protocol documentation)

When the whitepaper is silent, choose simplicity.
