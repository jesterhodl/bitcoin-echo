/**
 * Bitcoin Echo — PULL-Based Block Download Manager
 *
 * Cooperative work distribution:
 *
 * - Work is organized as BATCHES, not individual items
 * - Peers PULL work when idle, coordinator doesn't push
 * - Starved peers WAIT for work (cooperative, not punitive)
 * - Only truly stalled peers (0 B/s) are disconnected
 * - Sticky batches add redundancy for blocking blocks
 *
 * See IBD-PULL-MODEL-REWRITE.md for architectural details.
 *
 * Build once. Build right. Stop.
