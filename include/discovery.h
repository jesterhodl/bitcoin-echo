/**
 * Bitcoin Echo — Peer Discovery
 *
 * This module implements peer discovery mechanisms:
 * - DNS seed queries for bootstrap
 * - Hardcoded seed addresses as fallback
 * - addr/getaddr message handling for peer address relay
 * - Peer address storage and selection
 *
 * Peer discovery is essential for joining the Bitcoin network. A new node
 * uses DNS seeds or hardcoded addresses to find initial peers, then learns
 * about additional peers through addr messages.
