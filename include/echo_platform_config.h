/*
 * Bitcoin Echo — Platform Configuration
 *
 * These settings control platform-specific behavior: networking, storage,
 * resource limits, and operational parameters. Unlike consensus rules (which
 * must never change) and policy rules (which reflect philosophical choices),
 * platform settings are pragmatic operational decisions.
 *
 * These values may need adjustment as:
 * - Network conditions change
 * - Hardware capabilities evolve
 * - Operating systems update
 *
 * Platform changes do not affect consensus or policy. They affect performance,
 * resource usage, and operational characteristics.
